For each game, the score is listed in large bold print on the first line.
Then each individual who played in the game is listed, by team, along with
the number of each type of question answered (in the order that they appear
in the other reports (usually decreasing order, such as 15 10 -5).  The
last number after each name is the individual's total points for the game.
The next line of the boxscore gives, for each team, the total number of bonuses
heard, the total number of points scored on bonuses, and the average number of
points scored per bonus heard.
